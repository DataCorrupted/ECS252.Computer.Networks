\section*{Problem 1}

Consider sending a file of $F = M * L$ bits over a path of $Q$ links.
A link at $i$-th position along the path transmits at $i * R$ bps, e.g., the last link before the destination transmits at $Q * R$ bps.
The network is lightly loaded so that there are no queuing delays.
In order to send the file on a packet-switched network, its $M * L$ bits are broken up into $M$ packets, each packet with $L$ bits.
Also, suppose the network layers add a total of h bits of header to each packet.
How long does it take to send the file from source to destination?
Assume that the propagation delay is negligible.

\subsection*{Solution}

Since the smallest bandwidth of the path is the first link with $R$ bps, the total time would be:

$$ M(L+h)/R + \sum_{k=2}^Q (L+h)/kR $$
