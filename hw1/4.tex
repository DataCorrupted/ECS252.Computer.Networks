\section*{Problem 4}

In class we had derived did a simple queueing analysis to determine $\overline{N}$ which is the mean number of packets
in the system (buffer + transmitted).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the the variance of $N$?
    \item Plot (or tabulate) the mean and standard deviation $SD(N) = \sqrt{\rho V ar(N)}$ for different values of $\rho = 0.1, 0.2, \cdots , 0.9$.
    \item Why is a high value of $SD(N)$ bad for distributed networking applications?
\end{enumerate}
