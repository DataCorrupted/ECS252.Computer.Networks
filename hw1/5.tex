\section*{Problem 5}
In this problem we will consider that the buffer size of the single server queue studied in the lecture is finite and is of size $B$.
We still consider that the arrival process follows a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ packets/second and the service time is negative exponentially distributed with rate $\mu$ packets/second.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Derive an expression for the packet drop probability?
    \item Modify simulation code to simulate a finite buffer queuing system and validate simulation by comparing the simulation and the theoretical results.
          Consider $\mu = 1$. Use $B = 1, 10, 50$ and $\lambda = 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We would use Markov chain to try address this.

          Suppose state $S_k$ represents there are $k$ packets in the system.
          Thus $0 \le k \le B+1$.

          Therefore, $\lambda P_k = \mu P_{k+1} \Rightarrow P_k = \rho^k P_0$, however:

          $$ \sum P_k
              =  P_0(\rho^0 + \rho^1 + \cdots + \rho^{B+1})
              =  P_0 \frac{1 - \rho^{B+2}}{1-\rho} = 1 $$
          $$P_0 = \frac{1-\rho}{1 - \rho^{B+2}}$$
          $$P_k = \frac{1-\rho}{1 - \rho^{B+2}} \rho^{k}$$

          Now let's consider the probability of dropping packets.
          Since packets arriving and systems states are independ, we have:
          $$P = P(P_{B+1} | Arriving) = \frac{P_{B+1} P_{Arriving}}{P_{Arriving}} = P_{B+1} = \frac{1-\rho}{1 - \rho^{B+2}} \rho^{B+1}$$

    \item

                  It can be seen that using different $\lambda$ and $B$, the theoretical value and simulation value fits perfectly.

          The modified simulation code is too large.
          Even showing the diff would be difficult.
