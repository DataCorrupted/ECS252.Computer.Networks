\section*{Problem 5}
In this problem we will consider that the buffer size of the single server queue studied in the lecture is finite and is of size $B$.
We still consider that the arrival process follows a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ packets/second and the service time is negative exponentially distributed with rate $\mu$ packets/seconf.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Derive an expression for the packet drop probability?
    \item Modify simulation code to simulate a finite buffer queuing system and validate simulation by comparing the simulation and the theoretical results. Consider $\mu = 1$. Use $B = 1, 10, 50$ and $\lambda = 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9$
\end{enumerate}
