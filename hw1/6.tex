In the circuit switched world the basic unit of multiplexing was a T1 circuit which has a capacity of $1.544$
Mpbs and it could support 24 voice calls each at $64$ Kbps.
Consider a T1 circuit, a call holding time that is negatively exponentially distributed with mean call holding time of 180 seconds (the rate parameter $\mu$ of the exponential distribution is $1/180$.
Plot the call blocking probability as a function of the call arrival rate $\lambda$.
Consider $\lambda$ values such that $\lambda/\mu = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2$.
Plot the results.

\subsection*{Solution}

Given $m = 24, \rho = \lambda / \mu$.

$$P_m = \frac{\rho^m \frac{1}{m!}}{\sum_{k=0}^m \rho^k \frac{1}{k!}}$$
