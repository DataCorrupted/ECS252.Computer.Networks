\section*{Problem 6}

In the circuit switched world the basic unit of multiplexing was a T1 circuit which has a capacity of $1.544$
Mpbs and it could support 24 voice calls each at 64 Kbps.
Consider a T1 circuit, a call holding time that is negatively exponentially distributed with mean call holding time of 180 seconds (the rate parameter Âµ of
the exponential distribution is $1/180$.
Plot the call blocking probability as a function of the call arrival rate $\lambda$.
Consider $\lambda$ values such that $\lambda/\mu = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2$.
Plot the results.
