\section*{Problem 2}

Consider the Go-Back-N and the Selective Repeat algorithms.
Assume that k bits are used for sequence number.
What is the largest allowable window that will avoid the occurrence of the problem such as that in Figure 3.27 for each of the algorithms?
See Chapter 3 slide 75 and 76 .
