The following questions are related to the TCP protocol.

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \begin{enumerate}
              \item Slow start: 1 ~ 6.
              \item Congestion avoidance: 17 ~ 22.
              \item After 16th: Timeout
              \item After 22nd: Duplicated ACKs
              \item ~32.
              \item ~21.
              \item thessthresh /= 2; window size = thessthresh + 3 MSS.
          \end{enumerate}

    \item It means that you don't need an external clock or other device to sync the operations.
    \item The additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) mean that if there isn't a congestion, the window size is added linearly, i.e. everytime the size is added by an amount.
          If there is one, the size is penalized by a factor.
\end{enumerate}
