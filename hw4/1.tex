\section*{Problem 1}

Consider an end-to-end TCP connection in which the last hop is a wireless link.
Assume that MSS is 1500 bytes.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Suppose that packet error rate in the wireless link is $10^{-3}$.
          If the RTT is 50 msec, what is expectedthroughput of the TCP connection?
          (See Jupyter Notebook for an analysis of TCP throughput underrandom losses.)
    \item  What is the disadvantage of the TCP congestion control in the above scenario?
    \item  Suppose we can leverage a link layer error correction feature that can reduce the packet error rate to $10^{-5}$.
          However, it increases the RTT by 50 msec.
          What will be the expected throughput of the TCP connection in this case?
\end{enumerate}
