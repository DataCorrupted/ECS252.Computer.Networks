Suppose four active nodes - nodes A, B, C, and D - are competing for access to a channel using slotted ALOHA.
Assuming that each node has a infinite number of packets to send. Each node attempts to transmitin each slot with probability $p$.
The first slot is numbered 1, the second slot is numbered 2, and so on.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the probability that node A succeeds for the first time in slot 5?
          [Try to first find the probabilitythat node A succeeds in a slot].
    \item What is the probability that some node (either A, B, C or D) succeeds for the first time in slot 4?
    \item What is the probability that the first success occurs in slot 3?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Since each slot is independent with others, the stations are independent too, we can calculate the probability of successful transmit in anyone slot as:
          $$P(\text{NodeSuccess}) = p(1-p)^3$$
          \begin{align*}
                & P(\text{A success for 1st time in slot 5}) \\
              = & P(\text{NodeFail})^4P(\text{NodeSuccess})  \\
              = & p(1-p)^3 (1-p(1-p)^3)^4
          \end{align*}

    \item
          \begin{align*}
                & P(\text{Someone success for 1st time in slot 4})       \\
              = & {4 \choose 1}P(\text{NodeFail})^3P(\text{NodeSuccess}) \\
              = & {4 \choose 1}(1-p(1-p)^3)^3 \cdot p(1-p)^3             \\
              = & 4p(1-p)^3(1-p(1-p)^3)^3
          \end{align*}
    \item $$P(\text{ChannelSuccess}) = {4 \choose 1}p(1-p)^3$$
          \begin{align*}
                & P(\text{1st channel success in slot 3})           \\
              = & P(\text{ChannelFail})^2P(\text{ChannelSuccess})   \\
              = & (1- {4 \choose 1}p(1-p)^3)^2{4 \choose 1}p(1-p)^3 \\
              = & 4p(1-p)^3(1-4p(1-p)^3)^2
          \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
