\section*{Problem 3}

Suppose four active nodes - nodes A, B, C, and D - are competing for access to a channel using slotted ALOHA.
Assuming that each node has a infinite number of packets to send. Each node attempts to transmitin each slot with probabilityp.
The first slot is numbered 1, the second slot is numbered 2, and so on.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the probability that node A succeeds for the first time in slot 5?
          [Try to first find the probabilitythat node A succeeds in a slot].
    \item What is the probability that some node (either A, B, C or D) succeeds for the first time in slot 4?
    \item What is the probability that the first success occurs in slot 3?
\end{enumerate}
