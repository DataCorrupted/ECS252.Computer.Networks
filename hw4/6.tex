\section*{Problem 6}

Consider that service time of job is well modeled by a 2-state Markov Modulated Poisson Process.
In state 1 the service time is Exponential with rate is $\mu_1$ while in state 2 the service time is Exponential with rate is $\mu_2$.
The transitions between the states are governed by two independent Markov processes.
The transitionfrom state 1 to state 2 is with rate $\alpha$ while the transition from state 2 to state 1 is $\beta$.
What is mean servicetime and the Coefficient of Variation of the service time?
