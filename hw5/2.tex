\section*{Problem 2}

Consider the network fragment shown in Figure 1
$x$ has two attached neighbours, $w$ and $y$
$w$ has aminimum-cost path to destination $u$ (not shown) of 5 and $y$ has a minimum-cost path to $u$of 6
The completepath from $w$ and $y$ to $u$ (and between $w$ and $y$) are not shown
All link costs in the network have strictlypositive integer values.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Give $x$ distance vector for destination $w$, $y$, and $u$.
    \item Give a link cost change for either $c(x, w)$ or $c(x, y)$ such that $x$ will inform its neighbor of a newminimum cost path to $u$ as a result of executing the distance-vector algorithm.
    \item Give a link-cost change for either $c(x, w)$ or $c(x, y)$ such that $x$ will not inform its neighbors of a new minimum cost path to $u$ as a result of executing the distance-vector algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
