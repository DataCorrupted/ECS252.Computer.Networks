\section*{Problem 3}
Consider the network shown in Figure 2 and assume that each node initially knows the cost to each of its neighbors.
Consider the distance vector algorithm and consider the synchronous version that we discussed in class.
Answer the following questions

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Give the initial distance table of all the nodes.
      \item In the first round of exchange of distance vectors many distance vectors will node Z receive?
      \item Determine the distance table of node Z after the first round of exchange of distance vectors among
            the nodes.
\end{enumerate}

            \node[below right of=x](w){w};
            \node[right of=w](z){z};
